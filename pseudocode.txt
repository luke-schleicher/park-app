When navigating to the root, the user will come across a landing page with a short explanation of what they can do at the site. The focal point is a large, enticing search bar, where they can enter athletic activities they are interested in trying, or a zip code

The site then sends an API request to the City of Chicago's Park dataset and will return the data. 

Key findings we'll want to display on the dashboard: 

1) Any activities that match the search term
2) Any activities that are within a close range

Bonus: Result also displays a google map with the location pinned

Once they've searched, we'll give them the option to sign up in order to save their search results for next time. Once they've signed up and logged in, they can also view other people's profiles, and see if they can find an athletic buddy. 

They can also join groups that participate in athletic events every so often.

Bonus: Welcome email, direct message
