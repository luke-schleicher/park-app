@channel Homework: Tonight, your mission is to begin hacking.  Specifically, hacking together something useful that can be built with the SF Open Data API https://data.sfgov.org/ or your city's version (offered through Socrata https://dev.socrata.com/).  The mandate is to *build something useful*.   You will be rated according to both the content (is it actually useful/good?) and quality (does it work and the code is high quality?).  You will need to present your plan tomorrow morning (though feel free to build on it) at the normal Q/A time and you will ultimately present the app for review by your peers, deployed and with a great README, in the evening (a bit earlier than normal scrizzle time). You read this over the weekend, but it will be helpful for guiding your output; https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/dashboard#/getting-hired-phase-iii-go-all-in/about-take-home-challenges. Assume this is a “real” hackathon where you are responsible for presenting to a panel of judges on stage at the end, so your app needs to be deployed and presentable by the end of our time.  Don't worry about it being 100% original.  Quick tip: Scope is very important so make sure you can get it deployed in time!
